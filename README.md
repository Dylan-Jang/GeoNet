GeoNet
======

A GeoLocation by IP Address library for .Net

This is a very simple, but fast, library allowing querying of IP address location (country only) written in C#.

It's MIT licensed, so completely free.

The aim is to keep it very simple, with minimal external dependecies. There are no database files to keep updated, or any reliance on 3rd party modules with the exception of protobuf.

2. Put the file in the Resources folder of the GeoNet project
3. Compile Geonet.
