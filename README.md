GeoNet
======

A GeoLocation by IP Address library for .Net written in C#.

This is a very simple, but fast, library allowing querying of IP address location (country only) written in C#. It should work with ipv6 too, but I haven't been able to test properly.

It's MIT licensed, so completely free.

The aim is to keep it very simple, with minimal external dependecies. There are no database files to keep updated, or any reliance on 3rd party modules with the exception of protobuf.

HOW TO BUILD:

You can compile right out of the box, but if you want to build your own:
* Run the console application. This will generate a binary file 'geonet.bin'
* Put the file in the Resources folder of the GeoNet project
* Compile Geonet.
